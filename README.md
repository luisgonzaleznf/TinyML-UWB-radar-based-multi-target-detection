# Design of a Tiny Machine Learning system for UWB radar based multi target detection

In this repository you will find the most important notebooks from the Thesis document "Design of a Tiny Machine Learning system for UWB radar based multi target detection", by Luis Gonz√°lez Navarro

* **Chapter 3** includes notebooks regarding person counting with radar classification and regression, as well as 3-class image classification
* **Chapter 4** includes notebooks with optimizations to the 3-class radar classification architecture, including RAM optimization, dw convolutions and the use of average pooling
* **Chapter 5** includes notebooks that implement object detection on radar signals with two main approaches: using MSE loss and using a custom loss function
